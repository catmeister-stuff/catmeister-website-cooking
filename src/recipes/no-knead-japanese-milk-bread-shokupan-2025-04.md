intro: This bread is the _perfect sandwich bread_. Grilled cheese, soft squishy
  PB&Js and sloppy towers of meat and cheese and sauce slapped between two
  quivering slices. It doesn't require kneading, but it does require some
  patience. The poolish extends the shelf life further than _yudane_ alone - as
  long as you keep it wrapped, this bread won't stale for 4+ days **without
  preservatives**. Fuck yeah!
ingredients: |-
  *   One cup of milk
      
  *   One cup of flour
steps: |-
  1.  Drink the milk
      
  2.  Eat the flour
