title: No Knead Japanese Milk Bread (Shokupan / 食パン)

intro: >-
  This bread is the _perfect sandwich bread_. Grilled cheese, soft squishy PB&Js
  and sloppy towers of meat and cheese and sauce slapped between two quivering
  slices. It doesn't require kneading, but it does require some patience. The
  poolish extends the shelf life further than _yudane_ alone - as long as you
  keep it wrapped, this bread won't stale for 4+ days **without preservatives**.
  Fuck yeah!


  A forgiving recipe, you can swap the dairy for vegan alternatives without
  issue. I usually make it with country crock plant butter + full fat oat milk.
ingredients: >-
  #### Poolish


  *   165g bread flour
      
  *   165g water
      
  *   1/4t active dry or instant yeast (if you're baking in 4 hours) OR
  **1/16th** (if you're baking tomorrow morning and it's night)
      

  #### Yudane


  *   165g bread flour
      
  *   165g water
      
  *   165g full fat milk (cow or plant)
      

  #### Dough


  *   Poolish
      
  *   Yudane
      
  *   496g bread flour
      
  *   48g water
      
  *   71g milk
      
  *   14g ady
      
  *   49g sugar
      
  *   113g butter (one stick)
      
  *   17g salt
steps: >-
  1.  Anywhere from 4 to 12 hours before you make your dough, make your poolish:
      
      1.  Add yeast into water, stir, then add flour and mix until uniform. Personally, I think using a whisk for any sort of dough is nonsense - too much sticks to the whisk. Use chopsticks!
          
      2.  Cover and let sit at ~70F until bubbly and fermented. It's ready when a blob dropped in a cup of water will float.

          
  2.  When your poolish is ready, cook your yudane:
      
      1.  Combine the flour, water and milk in a sauce pan.
          
      2.  Weigh the entire thing - your sauce pan included. You want to know how much it weighs up front so you know how much liquid you've cooked off while gelatinizing your starch.
          
      3.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until temp reaches 150F - the mixture will be pudding like in consistency.
          
      4.  Let it cool enough so that you can weigh it again.
          
      5.  Subtract cooked weight from raw weight. This difference is how much liquid you've cooked off that needs to be added back to the recipe.
          
      6.  Add missing water back to pan while still warm and stir to combine. This also helps cool the yudane and loosens it up so it won't be so difficult to remove from the pan.

          
  3.  Measure your ingredient temperatures. Your **DDT** is 78F.
      
      1.  Measure the flour temp.
          
      2.  Measure the poolish temp.
          
      3.  Measure the yudane temp.
          
      4.  Measure the room temp.
          
      5.  From 390 (78\*5), subtract the flour, poolish, yudane and room temperatures.
          
      6.  This number is the temp of your water / milk.

          
  4.  Combine the water and milk and and either refrigerate or microwave to
  bring to the appropriate temp.
      
  5.  Add your liquid to the yudane, mixing uniformly.
      
  6.  Add your sugar and yeast, mixing uniformly.
      
  7.  Add your softened butter and mix until fully incorporated. Your mixture
  should be cool to not _melt_ the butter.
      
  8.  Add your salt and mix.
      
  9.  Add your poolish and mix.
      
  10.  FINALLY, add flour and mix. It'll be sticky, and it won't really hold
  together. THAT'S FINE! Fermentation will give you the gluten you need.
      
  11.  Now, you're going to leave this thing mostly alone, covered, for
  somewhere between 2 and 3 hours. You want the volume to double, and you want
  to pass the windowpane test. Every 45 minutes, you will stretch and fold
  twice. Keep it warm! If it's winter, I like to slop the dough onto my bench
  and then boil some water and pour it into a little glass and place it next to
  the dough, then invert a giant stainless steel bowl over it. Impromptu proof
  box!
      
  12.  After you've stretched and folded 3 times, see if dough passes the
  windowpane test. For me, I usually get windowpane at 2:15 and volume doubling
  at 2:30 or so.
